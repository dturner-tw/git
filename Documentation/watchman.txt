How git uses watchman
---------------------

Git status (and some other commands) have to determine which files
have changed between the working copy and the index.  Ordinarily, this
requires checking every file in the working directory.  But if you
have watchman (https://github.com/facebook/watchman) installed, git
can cache the state of the working directory and use watchman to track
file changes, making commands like git status faster.

set core.usewatchman = true to use watchman.
You can also set
core.watchmansynctimeout = [number of milliseconds]
to change watchman's sync timeout; see the watchman docs for details
on this.  You should only change this if you see watchman timeout
error messages.

Internals
---------

The filesystem cache stores information about every file in the
working tree.  In almost every case where git calls lstat or
opendir/readdir, the modified file cache can be consulted instead.

The file system cache is stored on disk in .git/fs_cache.  It is
stored very similarly to the index, except without path prefix
compression.
