In order to optimize git fetches on large repositories, a
journal-based replication scheme can be used.  The advantage of this
scheme is that there is no need for the client and server to
negotiate, nor for the server to construct custom packs for each
client.  Instead, the client is simply given all data that the server
has received.

The disadvantage is that selective fetches are not possible.  The
server sends all refs and objects that it knows about to the client.
