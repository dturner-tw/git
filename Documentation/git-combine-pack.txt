NAME
----
git-combine-pack - Combine multiple packs stupidly


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git combine-pack' [--size-lower-bound=<bytes>] [--size-upper-bound=<bytes>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Usually you don't want to use this command directly. Instead, try
'git gc'.

Combines all packs meeting the size criteria (default: all packs) into
one pack.  When there are many pack files, many git operations become
slow.  The 'combine-pack' command solves this problem by combining all
packs into one big pack.  This computation is not smart like gc -- it
doesn't compute deltas.  It just creates the new pack file with the
contents of several old ones.  However, it does eliminate duplicate
objects.  This command is much faster than 'git gc', since it need not
compute deltas.

Combining packs uses additional space roughly proportional to the
size of the packs less any savings from the removal of duplicate objects.

OPTIONS
-------
--size-lower-bound::
	Only combine packs smaller than the given size. This saves on
	working space, since the objects in large packs won't be
	copied, but produces a less-optimal result.

--size-upper-bound::
	Only combine packs larger than the given size.
