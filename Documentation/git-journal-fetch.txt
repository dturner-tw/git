git-journal-fetch(1)
===================

NAME
----
git-journal-fetch - Download from another repository using journals


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git journal-fetch' [--no-extract] [--journal-mirror] [--remote=<name>]
		    [--progress | --no-progress] [--disable-fetch-head]
		    [--quiet] [--verbose] [--no-detach]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Usually you don't want to use this command directly. Instead, 'git
fetch' will run it for you if the remote is configured for
journal-based replication.

Fetch refs and objects from another repository using journal-based
replication. Remote-tracking branches are updated.

include::journal.txt[]

Under the hood, this downloads and replays a journal, installing a
potentially large number of usually-small packs into the object
database.  Once it's done, it runs git combine-pack in the background
to combine all of the small packs (under combinepack.size-limit,
default 128 MiB).


OPTIONS
-------
--journal-mirror::
	Update metadata.bin and connectivity data. Don't delete
	replayed journals.

--remote<name>::
	Fetch from the remote named <name>

--progress::
	Display progress (default: only on interactive sessions).

--no-progress::
	Inhibit display of progress.

--disable-fetch-head:
	Disable writing of FETCH_HEAD for extracted tips

--no-extract::
	Don't extract packs and refs from the journal.  Useful for
	debugging journal problems.

--no-detach::
	Run combine-pack in the foreground instead of in the background.

--quiet::
	Minimal output.

--verbose::
	Increase diagnostic output.
