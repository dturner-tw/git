SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git journal-append'  auto <refname> <sha>
'git journal-append'  ref <refname> <sha>
'git journal-append'  pack <sha>
'git journal-append'  tips < ref-sha
'git journal-append'  upgrade

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Append to the journal.

include::journal.txt[]

This command should be used as an update-journal hook to append
newly-uploaded packs/refs to the journal.

COMMANDS
-------
auto::
	If it is not already present, append whatever pack contains
	the object with the provided sha.  Regardless, append a ref
	update.  The pack, together with all already-journaled packs,
	should contain all of the commit's contents (trees, blobs).

ref::
	Append just a ref update.  The sha is the ref's new sha.

pack::
	Append just a pack.  The sha is the pack's sha.

tips::
	Append a series of refs and packs from stdin; this is the bulk
	version of 'auto' (format: ref<sp>sha)

upgrade::
	Append a journal format upgrade notification.  Presently unused,
	since there is only one journal format.
